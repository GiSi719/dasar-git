You are generating a professional PAINT-BY-NUMBERS master artwork.

3. Each number MUST correspond to exactly ONE unique color.
4. NO two visually different colors are allowed to share the same number.
5. Thin, uniform, clean black outlines only.
6. NO color fills, NO shading, NO gradients, NO gray tones.

SUBJECT / THEME:
${prompt}

COLOR ANALYSIS REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL):
Before designing the palette, you MUST internally analyze the subject and list ALL DISTINCT REAL-WORLD COLORS required to realistically paint the scene.
Examples:
- Separate light green, dark green, yellow-green if they are visually different.
- Separate shadow colors, highlight colors, background colors, and object colors.
- Do NOT merge colors to reduce palette size.

COLOR PALETTE RULES (MANDATORY):
- The palette MUST include EVERY color identified in the color analysis step.
- The palette size MUST be determined by visual necessity, not an arbitrary limit.
- Each palette color MUST be assigned a unique number.
- EVERY number used in the drawing MUST appear exactly once in the palette.
- NO extra colors are allowed in the palette.
- NO missing colors are allowed.

PALETTE VISUAL LAYOUT:
- Display the palette as a grid or row of circular swatches.
- Place the palette cleanly at the bottom or in a corner.
- Each swatch must clearly show its number inside or next to it.
- The palette must not overlap the main drawing.

FORBIDDEN:
- No text labels, legends, titles, or explanations.
- No artistic interpretation that changes real-world colors.
- No simplification of color variety.

FINAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:
Output ONLY the final image.
No captions, no explanations, no text outside the image.
